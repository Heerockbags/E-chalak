note- there are two files in this, NAV1 file for nav bar, and the REFERENCE FILE, like if you have a doubt, you can check the reference file and PASTE the CODE SNIPPETS accordingly...
Follow the steps please :D

1. copy from <style> (9) to <div class="main"> (192)  and paste it before <div class="headContent" >{ for the HEAD CONTENT, check the reference file(203) }


2. COpy the span tag (200) and paste it after <div class="adminPart"> { reference file(205) }\
